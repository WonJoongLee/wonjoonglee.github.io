My personal tech blog built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme.

## Local Development

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Then visit <http://127.0.0.1:4000>.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger the GitHub Actions workflow which builds and deploys to GitHub Pages.
